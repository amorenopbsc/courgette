### Then...

| I expect to be on the 'PAGE_NAME' page | thenonpage | This step does 2 things: it changes the current page object so that any subsequent steps will use locators / selectors / XPaths from the PAGE_NAME page object, and then asserts the URL from that new page object if it exists. |
| I expect the url to contain 'STRING' | thenurlcontains | Using this just checks the URL, it does not change the page object so should not be used for end to end testing unless it is the final step |
